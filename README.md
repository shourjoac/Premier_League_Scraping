# Scraping Premier League Data

In this project, we will scrape data to eventually extract meaning from recent trends.

**Enlisting the steps which helped me conceptualize and implement the project:**

-   Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.
-   Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.


## Code

File overview:

-   `scraping.ipynb`  - a Jupyter notebook that scrapes our data.

# Local Setup

## Data


We'll be scraping  [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/)  to get our data in the first part of this project (`scraping.ipynb`).
